2/16/21, 2:03 pm - +48 733 499 999: Well so far  I did present Kieslowski and Pola≈Ñski. My friend did one Antonioni. We are not very lucky with Italian classics. Not many Italians are willing to present them. ;)

2/16/21, 2:37 pm - +48 733 499 999: Dear movie lovers!

I‚Äôm really sorry for recent confusion!
Because of Vallentines day there was no tickets left for Sunday screening days ahead, so we need to cancel.
.
Then today because od my mistake I  put event on 7:15 pm at Kika not 8:30 pm at Mikro (as it was voted for) with movie about Helmut Newton. 
.
But some of us bought already tickets for 7:15 so we will keep it.
.
There are still 5 tickets left! So who is going with us? üôÇ
.
It is always difficult to restart, but every next time it will be better! :)

May the great cinema stay with You!

Thank for marvelous evening last night! I watched this film 2nd time, it wasn't the best art documentary I have ever seen, but definitely thoughts provoking!
.
Furthermore the meeting after was even better! I really miss to talk with the movie lovers in person! ;)

Next week we will go to see Polish movie with English subtitles from the trailer bellow. It got 2 Polish Oscars (the best movie and the best sound of 2020) it was also nominated to Berlinale. 
I will announce the exact time after cinema will answer me. But we will meet on Tue evening. 
.
May the great movie be with you! :)

My friends did shopping for me so I‚Äôm ok and even trying to catch up with movies. Initially even humor in familly guy series was cognitively too much demanding for me... ;) But now I feel a little bit better and want to check Golden Globes nominees. Have you seen and recomend any of those?

3/4/21, 4:02 pm - +48 733 499 999: I actually love that. And I‚Äôm sure that we will miss those days. Meaning studio cinemas play art house movies and you go when you want. Corporative cinemas they first need to brainwash people with huge marketing budget. Because otherwise nobody will go to see those mainstream productions. I know it is also a matter of contracts etc, but I was always kind of rebel and for me is beautifull and romantic that you can go only to studio cinemas and watch art house movies. ;)
3/4/21, 4:05 pm - +48 733 499 999: Kika normally charge 25 PLN, but on Tue or Wed, they charge 14, so you have almost your 1+1. In most of those cinemas usually one day was cheaper. To be sure message them directly on fb.

The film is interesting in that it introduces, in a semi-documentary form, the life of people (mainly the elderly) who have decided to spend the rest of their lives in a camper, driving around the United States, doing seasonal work. The natural attractions of the country are shown. Very good views, nice music, actors and very melancholic film. I think it worth to see, it reminds Easy rider of Dennis Hopper, but main character is woman and very good actress

In fact I guess I saw the 2nd part where it was portrayed in Baikal.

It's good tho, to show and highlight how Russia is beyond Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which is mostly not portrayed at all.

4/5/21, 1:48 pm - +48 733 499 999: Dear movie lovers. One advantage of watching classic movies is the fact that... there is so much literature about. Our next movie with so many reviews, articles, lectures, books, MA and doktorate thesis is great example of it. Probably there is no other Polish film with more literature about it! :)

4/14/21, 8:23 pm - +48 733 499 999: Our tomorrow movie is based on Jerzy Pilch semi selfbiographical book with the same title: "The mighty angel" (Pod mocnym anio≈Çem) 

Book was rewarded with golden Nike, Polish highest literature award by both critics and readers!

It made Pilch even more popular writer. Eventhough there were already legends about how much he have been drinking in Krak√≥w bars. Stories about his sexual life may us call him Polish literature Mick Jagger from Rolling Stones. 

So it is very typical Krak√≥w literature and very Krakowian movie. Wojciech Smarzowski, the director initially thought that it is unfilmable. But then he found a key to film it. I wonder if we will discover this key tomorrow during discussion.

Jerzy Pilch died at age 68 about year ago. But he have seen the movie and surprised himself that he liked it a lot!

See you tomorrow at 7 pm!

4/16/21, 5:36 pm - +48 733 499 999: About six years ago I started: Polish movies with English subtitles. 

Almost every 2nd week since then I presented great Polish films and discuss about it with English speaking audience. 
.
This picture is from one of the first screenings I'm first from the right. 2nd from the left is Francisco. He came for Erasmus exchange to Krak√≥w already being in love with Polish cinema. He came with his luxury Spanish edition of Polish classic: "Ashes and diamonds", and he said that we have to watch it together on my screenings. 

He was so dedicated to Polish cinema, that he traveled all around the country to visit legendary locations related to history of Polish film.
.

It was finally him who inspired me to start 2nd project. Movies presented by natives. A chance for people from all around the world to present movie from their country, therefore share culture. So since that time almost every other 2nd week we were screening foreign film.

Through this time, the more I learn about cinema, the more I appreciate and end up being fascinated with movie tourism. I did walk in Vienna like Orson Welles did in 3rd man, I did sit on red desert in Jordan like Matt Damon did in Martian, etc.
.

In Krak√≥w in terms of movie tourism there is only one topic: Schindler's list. Of course I did hundreds of tours about it. But I also designed totally new author tour, that nobody ever did before: Pola≈Ñski and "the Pianist". 

The Pianist was Polish coproduction, but it is still not a classic of Polish cinema. So I have been thinking for years about the open air tour on which I could share my passion to great Polish cinema. Especially that I did guide in National museum amazing exhibition about Andrzej Wajda's movies. But this one was unfortunately temporary.
.

Nevertheless finally my dream came true. I designed author unique tour about the greatest movies filmed in Krak√≥w.

Premiere of that will be this weekend. I believe that it will become crucial moment in history of Krak√≥w's movie tourism. :)

There are still some places left, tour is here:

Thank you very much for screening on Thursday and discussion. Indian style after party was also cool. :)

As I said next week will come back to the project Movies presented by natives. So Guglielmo have chosen an Italian film, which I havn't watch. So he will present it, while I will sit, listen and enjoy the movie that somebody deliberately have chosen for us from his national cinema. I don't know how about you but for me it sounds fascinating! ;)

My friend noticed that it was probably inspired by Abbey Road, cover by the Beatles! Despite the fact, that this legendary music album was released 9 years later.
.
So could the best Polish new wave jazz movie by inspiration to one of the most famous album in history of pop music? 
.
Taking in to consideration fact, that Wajda's movie was screened in the early 60ties in UK on movie festival it is very likely!

5/23/21, 8:01 pm - +48 733 499 999: Do you think that it was obligatory in some of those countries or simply he was ‚Äûjust‚Äù popular?
5/23/21, 8:02 pm - +48 733 499 999: How about movie based on Stanis≈Çaw Lem literature? Have you seen any?
5/23/21, 8:03 pm - +1 (857) 331-3500: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(1972_film)
5/23/21, 8:03 pm - +1 (857) 331-3500: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(2002_film)
5/23/21, 8:07 pm - +48 733 499 999: Nick? Which you prefer? Soviet or Hollywood? ;)
5/23/21, 8:13 pm - +48 570 415 962: No it was not obligatory to read his books. In soviet union it was not possible to get books from west due to cenzorship. People could only read right soviet authors in Russia or countries of Soviet block. At that time all Autors books were printed and Sold at cheap prises, big amounts. TV was not showing lot of si-fi and people really enjoed by reading Lem, Strugatsky brothers, Kir Bulytchev, Alexey Tolstoy etc. It was good was to spend time after work.
5/23/21, 8:19 pm - +48 570 415 962: I have read Soliaris at school and Invincible . I have heard  about book Tales of Pirx the Pilot and really whant to read it
5/23/21, 8:24 pm - +1 (857) 331-3500: Solaris of Tarkovsky was considered as a Soviet reply to Kubrick's "2001‚Äù. Both were about the first alien encounter, both were the milestones in sci fi thinking of alien intelligence. But Tarkovsky‚Äôs movie is more inward and psychological, I would say. Obviously, the Hollywood movie (Solaris of 2002 starring Clooney) is modern and a lot more entertaining to watch.
5/23/21, 8:38 pm - +44 7944 565423: Return from the stars, tales of Pirx the pilot, Fiasco.
5/23/21, 8:39 pm - +44 7944 565423: I have only watched Solaria
5/23/21, 8:39 pm - +44 7944 565423: Solaris*
5/23/21, 8:48 pm - +48 570 415 962: Just my opinion about Tarkovskis Soliaris. Very tiresomely film, quality of actors performannce are not good. Tarkovski wanted to show serious reflection of people to life situations and reaction to environment, behavior in certain circumstances and many film scenes are long because of that. Actors could not make good work. 
Soderberghs Soliaris is commercial product with George Clooney, end of film is very bad. Stanislav Lem did not like both films if I am not mistaken
5/23/21, 8:50 pm - +44 7944 565423: I will take your recommendation and probably going to read the book. I am not a big fan of the Clooney movie either.

May great cinema be with you!

5/27/21, 4:55 pm - +48 733 499 999: "Are you alive Mr. Jones" is a story by Stanis≈Çaw Lem firstly published in 1955 in Polish magazine Przekr√≥j. 14 years later it became the very first text of Lem translated and published to English in British / Australian magazine Vision of future, that was the introduction:

"Stanis≈Çaw Lem is one of the most important Polish science fiction writers. His texts are widely read in Europe in seventeen languages. However, it has never been translated into English, and our magazine is proud to introduce Lem's work to English-speaking readers."

So apparently Lem was translated eventually even into this exotic language called English. :)

Today we will see movie based on this first translated to English story of Stanis≈Çaw Lem.

I will be there at 6 to do table football tournament, movie presentation will start at 7:30 pm.
See you there!

6/2/21, 12:08 pm - +48 733 499 999: It is one screening, three movies 15 PLN. There is NO point to buy any multi screenings pass now in the middle of the festival. Especially that 10 pass works only online. So you will have to pay 200 PLN for entire karnet. Which make sense only if you are planning to go for more than 14 screenings in cinemas till Sunday.

Some interesting Russian films were place on Netflix. I recommend to watch. Film director Alexey Balabanov can be compared to Gaspar Noe or Michael Haneke, and even to Quentin Tarantino. His films have their own dark charm. If you will watch, i would appreciate your opinion.

At first it‚Äôs just low budget crime movie, but it‚Äôs much much more then that. It tells the story about post-soviet generation. The lost-generation as I call them. Poverty, violence, wars. Also movie soundtracks are great.  Worth to watch ‚Ä¶

6/9/21, 12:33 pm - +48 733 499 999: During almost 7 years of our movie club, we rarely screen movies made by very popular directors who did films in English language.

We simply rather avoid mainstream cinema, and screen something more ambitious or / and unusual.

This week will be an exception with Stanley Kubrick, who is one of the most legendary movie director, but his films are definitelly still arthouse movies! 

One advantage of screening famous director movie is the fact that on there is documentary about him available on netflix.

Have you seen this one or any other? I have just watched it yesterday to prepare for our movie screening. ;)

Maybe any of you even remember museum exhibition of Stanley Kubrick movies which was in National gallery of Kraj√≥w a few years ago?

6/10/21, 4:15 pm - +48 733 499 999: NOBODY TOLD SLIM PICKENS THEY WERE MAKING A SATIRE.

Before being cast as Dr. Strangelove‚Äôs gung-ho bomber pilot Major. T. J. Kong, actor Slim Pickens had starred almost exclusively in Westerns, with nary a comedy part to his name (much less a political satire). This didn‚Äôt pose much of a problem, however, as Kubrick deemed the actor‚Äôs natural cadence and decorum to be perfect for the cowboy soldier. 

Kubrick led Pickens to believe that the film was supposed to be a serious war drama, prompting him to carry himself as he might in any of his Western pictures. Furthermore, according to James Earl Jones (who made his film debut in Dr. Strangelove) and Kubrick biographer John Baxter, Pickens behaved, and dressed, identically onscreen and off ‚Ä¶ not because he was ‚Äústaying in character,‚Äù but because he apparently always acted like that.
6/10/21, 4:16 pm - +48 733 499 999: So it is really a Texas mentality soldier. Btw John Wayne was proposed to play it also, but have never respond to Kubrick. :)
6/10/21, 4:17 pm - +48 733 499 999: Here it is legendary gif from dr Strangelove with Slim Pickens ride as all texas soldiers should do! ;)

6/30/21, 8:55 pm - +48 733 499 999: I come from recovered lands.

It is the area which used to be Germany before WW2 and was given to Poland as a kind of recompansation for about half of Polish pre war teritory annexed by Soviet Union.

This fact has some peculiar consequences. For example my village (Czarna DƒÖbr√≥wka, Shwartz Damerkoff in German), prewar history was always hidden and uknown for me therefore very exiting.

All my neighbours were from different part of Poland or areas which is today Lithuania or Ukraine. Therefore most people speak there pure Polish, to prove their Polishness. That‚Äôs why I have no accent and speak Queen‚Äôs Polish. So I have plenty of language anecdotes during my 17 years in Krak√≥w, because many locals are not even aware when they speak Krakovian dialect not Queen‚Äôs Polish any longer. ;)

Post war transition time was on one hand crucial moment which creates today‚Äôs Poland on the other hand it is kind of legendary and mythological.

In my family there are still many stories from the period. For example my grand father did trade post german agriculture tools and machines from recovered lands for livestock from rest of Poland. He was often paid by gold and apparently have earned so much that was enough to cover costs of life and his later unsuscessfull business for several decades!

Filmwise when we think about leaving Germans and Polish setlers comming with hope of new better land it is very western genre story.

Therefore the most legendary Polish western genre film ‚ÄûLow and the fist‚Äù is set in the recovered lands just after the war.

Tomorrow during my movie club Good movies with Pawel, I will present this film, talk about my personal story of recovered lands and this masterpiece of Polish cinema.

Stay cultured!

The movie was challanging, set in historical times, and 2h20m, but a masterpiece, the only postsoviet bloc movie with Oscar. Filmed in very short and unique period of Russian cinema history.

I love to watch short movies, which are offer much more creative, because cheaper, therefore more courageous. The most fascinating is to watch early short movies of people who later became icons of full feature cinema. Because in the very beginning of cinema masterpiece there should be brave idea not only money...

This Thu we will watch my personal choice of shorts made by great Polish directors: Bagi≈Ñski, Munk, Pola≈Ñski and Kie≈õlowski.

See you SHORTly! ;)

An Andalusian Dog (director¬†Luis Bu√±uel¬†and Salva dor Dal√≠) is perfect and classical movie. I watched also short comedis by Leonid Gaidai which I really like since my childhood.

As interesting comparison - in post soviet Russia the most popular film in cinemas was Avatar, and 13 million people had seen them in 2009, the next one was sport drama Three seconds with 11 millions, all other popular films could not rea h even 8 million in cinemas. And one film with Belmando could collect box office  with 20-30 million people 30 years ago easilyüòÄ

Stanis≈Çaw Lem 

Lem is definitely the most popular sci-fi author in Middle - Eastern Europe, and one of the most popular in the world, translated to 44 different languages. 

2021 it would be his 100 years anniversary therefore it is officially Stanis≈Çaw Lem's year in Poland. Therefore as we will finally for the very first time screen the most famous movie based on his book directed by legendary Andrey Tarkovsky. Ladies and Gents, this Thu we will go together to "Solaris"!

May the great cinema be with you!

This is russkiy drug of mine Andrey.

I have meet him almost 2 years ago when he still have been living in Gliwice and commuting for my tours and movie meetings to Krak√≥w.

Andrey lives in Krak√≥w now and is one of the most active member of my movie club Good movies with Pawel.

On internet forums about cinema he asked way more questions than I do!

We have been discussing screening an icon of Russian art house cinema - Andrey Tarkovsky for more than year already. Nevertheless the time have come!

2021 would be 100 years anniversary of one of the greatest sci-fi writter of all, translated to 45 languages, Stanis≈Çaw Lem. Therefore it is oficially Lem‚Äôs year in Poland.

So for the first time in 7 years history of our movie club we will screen legendary ‚ÄûSolaris‚Äù by Tarkovsky based on Lem. 

See you tomorrow at 7 pm on planet Solaris.

10/5/21, 8:14 am - +48 510 762 045: Is that a comedy movie my friend? @48733499999

10/5/21, 8:22 am - +48 515 828 236: It's a drama. Stanis≈Çaw Lem was writing futurist si-fis and dramas
10/5/21, 8:58 am - +44 7854 169452: Hi again @48733499999 Sorry, I just realised you'd already given the location.  Do tickets have to be purchased online in advance - or is it also possible to buy tickets on the door?
10/5/21, 10:47 am - +48 733 499 999: It is free of charge. It is just nice to buy something at the bar before screening and during a break as they gave us room for free.
10/5/21, 10:57 am - +48 510 762 045: Dobrze üëç
10/5/21, 11:09 am - +48 515 144 253: Hi everyone! üëã
I can see it may be needed to say a few words before Thursday's film (especially since a lot of us come by spontaneously üòâ). 

This week we selected a film based on a novel of a famous Polish sci-fi writer, Stanislaw Lem within this year's initiative to commemorate his work (100. anniversary). It is a brilliant film with a great cast, but it tackles a very difficult subject and deals with moral dilemmas (just as Lem's books do). 

Please mind that the screening may not be easy for sensitive viewers. If you are expecting a comedy, maybe it's better to omit this one. But if you are interested in war themes/you're curious of Lem's adaptations, then definitely join us this week üé¨ See you!

On August 26, the Polish Film Festival began in St. Petersburg in "Velikan-Park".
The program includes contemporary Polish cinema, St. Petersburg premieres: films by Agnieszka Holland, Maciej Pepszyca and Bartosz Kruchlik, as well as the classics of Polish cinema - Edward Zhebrowski's film "Hospital of the Transfiguration", screening in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Stanislav Lem, the world famous writer - science fiction writer, author of the novel. By the way, 2021 has been declared the Year of Stanislaw Lem in Poland.

10/8/21, 12:14 am - +48 570 415 962: Thanks a lot for screening the movie today. I also really like presentation. My impression: when madmen come to power, they infect everyone with madness. This happened in Germany in the 30s, and even now such examples can be found without problems. I will try to read Lems book as wellüòÄüëç
10/8/21, 9:06 am - +48 510 762 045: It was quite good and at times soul wrenching.

So this Thu we will see classic 007 with Roger Moore, who is consider the closest ever actor to the original Ian's Flemming idea.

During 7 years of our movie club Good movies with Pawe≈Ç we were not affraid to screen all kinds of movies, experimental Portuguese, amateur productions by some of our members from Algeria, classical Polish or 3 h legendary Russian art house. So why not once a while mainstream pop culture? 

See you at 0:07! Pardon 7:00 pm ;P

10/10/21, 10:39 pm - +48 570 415 962: Thanks Pawel. It is big and interesting question who was best player for James Bond role. Some movie polls  say it Sean Connery (1st place),  Timothy Dalton (2 place), Pierce Brosnan (3 place) but probably Roger Moor is more close to book character. I am curious to know opinion of Bill on ThursdayüòÄ

10/12/21, 3:35 pm - +48 733 499 999: Nevertheless September 2014 was amazing experience in my whole cultural life. At Krakow‚Äôs one the best festival (Film music festival) ppl were voting entire summer for the best Bond songs and the highest voted were performed in Tauron arena!

10/12/21, 3:47 pm - +48 733 499 999: Songs were performed by main nation wide famous Polish artist. Like Zbigniew Wodecki who performed: From Russia with love. (His accent fits perfectly!)

10/12/21, 3:49 pm - +48 733 499 999: But that day and Bond concert was the first time I fully understand Max Berg statement: 20 century is the time when cathedrals were made of concrete.
10/12/21, 3:50 pm - +48 733 499 999: For Mister Berg who constructed UNESCO listed building - centennial hall in Wroclaw. The fact that a few thousands ppl could attend to cultural events to the largest domme building at that time in the world was symbol of democracy!
10/12/21, 3:52 pm - +48 733 499 999: So I paid 6 PLN for return tram tickets, 30 PLN for entrance. Therefore for a cost of 2 craft beers I did participate together with 18000 ppl in one of the most world unique movie music cultural event! Unforgetable!
10/12/21, 3:53 pm - +48 733 499 999: No suprise that month after I did listen to Bond music over and over again. Because of our Thu screening it is exactly what I do now for a few days already. ;)

10/25/21, 10:08 am - +48 733 499 999: Dear movie lovers! For almost 7 years of our movie club we very rarely screen my favourite film genre which is Scandinavian black comedy. Partially because most of Scandinavian ppl in Krak√≥w are too busy with their medical studies. ;) But this Thu we will screen Danish movie presented by two girls passionate about Denmark who learn Danish! :)
10/25/21, 10:08 am - +48 733 499 999: Adam‚Äôs apples review: There are dark comedies. There are pitch black comedies. And then, there's Adam's Apples.

If you want to watch a movie that takes some of the most depressing, horrible things you can think of, and makes them absolutely hilarious, this is the movie for you.

10/26/21, 6:57 pm - +48 500 694 497: I think most of the movies have polish subtitles in the cinema here so if the original movie is in English, you can watch it (from my experience at least)

I suppose some of us can bring best example of short movies from your country and we can make screening. It can be different  from surrealistic movies like Andalusian Dog from 1929, Vincent Van Gogh short movie, Kie≈õlowski or Tarantino or Tim Burton short films. I had good experience in my country, and i really like one of such night.

10/27/21, 7:56 am - +48 733 499 999: ?
10/27/21, 7:57 am - +48 733 499 999: Well we never discuss much the selection. We rather trust person from the country where movie was made and love to be surprised. :)
10/27/21, 7:58 am - +972 52-671-7593: Interesting a lot of action
10/27/21, 9:41 am - +48 570 415 962: I am thinking to bring some old short movie, the first movie Stenka Razin was made in Imperial Russian in 1908 and a one Animation short film famous around the World which is called Hedgehog in the Fog (Yuri Norstein). We can also add first film of Lumier Brothers or A trip to Moon by Georges Mellies (1908)
 I have found also interesting modern film Lumiere and Company, 1995. It is 40 famous film directors made short movie each with Cinematographe Camera of Lumiere brothers: Michael Haneke, Andrey Konchalovski, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Wim Wenders and others. I am open to any ideas
10/27/21, 9:43 am - +48 570 415 962: These movies were just 53 sec each, no sound, only 3 takes. The did it for 100 year anniversary of world cinema
10/27/21, 10:48 am - +48 733 499 999: I would prefer that each, movie or set of movies will be presented by one person, who will prepare presentation. That will easier lead to interesting discussion.

10/27/21, 12:09 pm - +48 515 144 253: Yes, I've seen it in 4D, a really good film, especially if you enjoy sci-fi. 
It made me want to read the book. It's classic and seems really intriguing as the movie is based mainly on the visuals and action, while the book elaborates a bit more on the religion/culture/habits of the depicted societies.
10/27/21, 12:09 pm - +48 515 144 253: Have you read the book, Bartek?

Furthermore I will never watch at Wis≈Ça river in the middle of Krakow the same wat after watching this... we still wait for a Good horror about Wis≈Ça, or... Wawel hill. Did I ever mention that any from the Wawel cathedral guards want to have a night shift? Because there are some ... noices. This is what my friend who work there told me.

Looks like this short film was done by Polish film director Tomasz Baginski, and it about Krakow
10/30/21, 8:42 am - +48 733 499 999: That was promotion of Allegro, together with Twardovsky, which we have watched during our short movies night. ‚ÄûPolish ebuy‚Äù, Allegro produced this series of Polish legends. It is really well done in fact. Bagi≈Ñski is star of Polish animations.

10/30/21, 10:06 am - +48 733 499 999: Btw remember also about our Polish Canadian movie lover Adam, who did present classics of David Cronenberg movies. Fly was definitelly horror.

https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9812474/
10/30/21, 10:31 am - +48 571 386 869: If the question is around personal choices for horror, both in general and from my homeland, then that is a different story. 
So to go down that path, Wolf Creek and the Snowtown Murders would be a couple of Australian ones. Some may consider Mad Max vaguely in the horror category depending where you sit on the squirmish spectrum but not for me.

In terms of horror in general, a few top picks over the decades are:

A Nightmare on Elm Street 
Child‚Äôs Play (‚Äúnothing like a little strangulation to get the circulation going‚Äù springs to mind).
Hostel
Psycho
Return of the Living Dead (comedy horror I am sure)
Saw
The Blair Witch Project
The Exorcist
The Reanimator
The Ring

I do not really consider these too horrific, but Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer were always entertaining for their obviousness in the storyline (do not go in the kitchen - ok, another one bites the dust). 

Am sure there are others but my DVD collection is 15,000kms away and apologies to Stephen King‚Äôs collection as some great ones amongst them.

11/3/21, 11:06 pm - +48 570 415 962: I can tell that this movie will not be boring for you even it was made in 1967, the story is great (young priest attempts to save the soul of a witch with which he has a sordid backstory). 
Also I am going to screen after msin fim the small animated movie which won Oscar award for best animated film in 2000, based on famous Ernest Hemingway novel "The Old Man and the Sea" very unique technology for animationüòâ
11/4/21, 10:15 am - +48 733 499 999: Jamie Havlin looks at a unique and groundbreaking movie made in Ukraine during the Soviet era that has been called one of the greatest horror movies of all-time.

Imagine living in a totalitarian regime with a strict code of censorship in operation, where the public can‚Äôt be trusted to watch anything other than state approved cinema and television, and where horror movies have to date been deemed ideologically inappropriate. Then imagine how cinema goers in the Soviet Union must have felt as the country‚Äôs first horror movie was finally filmed and given a theatrical release in 1967.

Luckily, VIY was allowed to be made as it was based on the work of a state approved author with a worldwide reputation in Nikolai Gogol, whose novels and short stories were even enjoyed by Stalin. If penned by a contemporary writer, the authorities would have clamped down and the film would never have been approved.

This is absolutely not the case for film Viy where the actress is beatific young lady Natalia Varlei (she has some Romanian roots in family).

This is movie is in my personal best top 3 Polish comedies, and top 10 the best comedies of all. The irony there, over intelectualization, negativness, complains, jealousy are so traditionaly Polish!

You may say it is nothing funny? Well that's the point! ;)

11/26/21, 8:13 pm - +48 570 415 962: Hi guys,
As announced by Pawel, next week there will be screening of classical Metropolis film by Fritz Lang.
German Expressionist cinema has made a significant impact on contemporary cinema, with a unique visual style that can be found from American blockbusters to small animated short films. German Expressionist cinema has featured in the work of many prominent filmmakers, including the American film director Tim Burton. 
I personally like Tim Burton for his films Edward Scissorhands,¬†Batman,¬†Batman Returns,¬†Sleepy Hollow,¬†Big Fish,¬†and¬†Alice in Wonderland. He has taken a lot from expressionism. Other films heavily influenced by German Expressionism include Guillermo del Toro‚Äôs¬†Pan‚Äôs Labyrinth(2006), Alex Provas‚Äô¬†The Crow(1994), Ridley Scott‚Äôs¬†Blade Runner(1982), and Alfred Hitchcock‚Äôs¬†Vertigo(1958) 
The expressionist cinema hopes ‚Äúto show the world in a fantasy light, a liminal space where dreams, imagination and desire be briefly reconciled with harsh realities.‚Äù
The film will be shown with subtitles which explaining scenes and story, so no worries to be confused üòâ 
I will try to make presentation interesting together with Chrissi from Germany. 
See you next Thursday in movie clubüòâ

I don't think there were enough theaters back then for such big investment to pay itself off.
Maybe tickets were much more expensive than today.

What were the earnings if that info even exists?

12/1/21, 5:15 pm - +48 733 499 999: Metropolis is hallucinatory nightmare without the reassurance of a steadying story line. Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating.

This week during our movie club @good movies with Pawel we will screen classic of classics, Metropolis by Fritz Lang. 

May the great cinema be with you!

12/7/21, 10:09 am - +48 733 499 999: Interesting summary of Thu movie:
12/7/21, 10:10 am - +48 733 499 999: This film is very close to the Polish countryside, Polish problems and Polish Catholicism. The great revelation of Gdynia film festival, unfortunately completely ignored by public tv, exudes courage. It reminds us that the world is made up of differences and that fighting contempt is nowhere. You can see yourself in it, do an examination of conscience. It doesn't matter which side of the divided Poland you are on.

Rge main character is unique from my point of view (I have not heard about such examples in my country in villages.). Also I like efforts of main characters to be a person regardless all these bulling and xenophobic behavior of locals. I really liked music and views of Polish village. But in the same time scenes with bulling were shown quote softly and in most of cases it just words. Beu in general it was good experience for me. Thanks to Wiktor for explanation and proposal to watch it

12/15/21, 7:03 pm - +48 733 499 999: That will be our special guest star of tomorrow: movies presented by natives.  Double native: Jewish and Newyorker: Jonathan Ornstein!
12/15/21, 7:05 pm - +48 733 499 999: JCC executive director Jonathan Ornstein, 46, is The New York City native has built the vibrant Jewish community center from the ground up, starting as its sole employee eight years ago and overseeing ‚Äúexponential growth in terms of what we‚Äôre doing here.‚Äù

Ornstein was headed to law school when he deferred his studies and moved to Israel in 1994, where he served as a lone soldier in the Israel Defense Forces. He was living on a kibbutz in the Negev when he fell in love with a Polish woman. That led to his move to Poland, where the romantic relationship faded but where Ornstein developed a strong attachment to Krakow and took a job teaching Hebrew at Jagiellonian University.

Today he oversees a bustling JCC with more approximately 40 employees, a corps of 55 non-Jewish volunteers, 600 members and year-round programs for all ages, including weekly Shabbat dinners for about 60 local Jews and visitors from around the world. Later this month, construction is scheduled to begin on classrooms for an early childhood center, notes Michelle Ores, in town for the festival and board president of the New York-based Friends of JCC Krakow.

Those legendary quotations from Pigs 2 sounds much more cool when I was 9 yo, than today... üòâ Nevertheless it is still a big history of Polish cinema so I'm very glad that after so many years I found this film with English subtitles!

"Pigs" and "Pigs 2"  were not just movies, in 1990ties there were considered cult and great hope for Polish cinema!

1/15/22, 1:47 am - +995 591 90 04 41: Oh Turkish western ‚Ä¶ Sounds interesting
1/15/22, 4:38 pm - +48 570 415 962: It is really good idea to watch Turkish movies. Unfortunately I have zero experience with them however turkish TV series are also popular in my country (for example TV series The Magnificent Century)
1/15/22, 7:14 pm - +90 538 681 01 67: This one is a comedy :) I think you will enjoy it!
1/15/22, 7:16 pm - +90 538 681 01 67: The Magnificent Century is definitely a great series, very dramatic and captivating. An artistic approach in retelling historical events.
1/15/22, 7:44 pm - +48 570 415 962: I did not watch it but my mother liked it a lotüòÄ
1/15/22, 7:46 pm - +90 538 681 01 67: The movie on Thursday is a light-hearted satire about Turkish and American (mainly the Wild West) stereotypes. I believe the perspective this movie offers is a significant  one since it portrays how Turks are able to make fun of themselves and how they perceive the "wild west". I will be hosting the event next week. Looking forward to hearing your opinions on it ‚ò∫Ô∏è

1/25/22, 8:05 pm - +48 503 769 590: Saw Titane, at Agrafka cinema. Epic filmmaking, It won the Golden Palm at Cannes!, Recommend it,,, but not for the faint-hearted ;)
1/25/22, 8:10 pm - +30 694 955 1231: I totally hated it
1/25/22, 8:10 pm - +30 694 955 1231: üòÖüòÖüòÖ
1/25/22, 8:11 pm - +30 694 955 1231: And i absolutely loved raw
1/25/22, 8:13 pm - +48 503 769 590: I think it's a film that will blow you away or youll hate it. (And How about the ending? ;) )
1/25/22, 9:00 pm - +48 570 415 962: I also watched this movie. Then I read an interview with the film director where she said that she often had a strange dream where she gave birth to pieces of the engine. Then she connected it with the theme of love and feminism. In general, the film slightly follows style of David Kroneberg. And the prize in Cannes was given to her by Spike Lee, and she did not expect him at all. Quite strange story but interesting to watch
1/25/22, 9:40 pm - +48 723 922 662: Hello! Is there going to be a movie this Thursday?
1/26/22, 8:13 am - +30 694 955 1231: Everything but the music was horrible,for my taste
1/26/22, 12:15 pm - +39 348 053 7444: For me it's totally the second option. A childish and sadly trendy imitation of Tetsuo + half of Cronenberg's filmography. I didn't love Raw, but was a masterpiece compared with Titane.
1/26/22, 12:30 pm - +48 733 952 999: Yes there is a film on Thursday and we will post details later, hope to see you there. Bill

1/27/22, 7:15 pm - +48 733 499 999: Bill promise to make a few slides so I‚Äôm very excited. :)
1/28/22, 8:22 pm - +48 503 769 590: I haven't seen Raw, but a couple of people here have mentioned it. I can screen it at my place (the film's available online). I have a projector and enough seats for 7-8 people and I live centrally. If we can get enough people interested, I'll do it. Just attach a reply to this message if you're interested. Btw its a previous film by the director from this years Cannes best film winner. We can have a discussion after the film. (Hope Pawel doesn't mind me doing this..sounds like competition to his movie  nights haha, but don't worry Pawel, we are just movie fans, enjoying film..and it won't happen on a Thursday.. :) )
1/29/22, 8:59 am - +48 570 415 962: Beside Titan and Raw, I am just curious guys what is your opinion about best non-mainstream movie in 2021. I have found such list of film  the author is explaining it is really good ones. I have not watched all of them yet. Any opinions which film was best for you in 2021?
Azor
Barb and Star Go to Vista del Mar
Benedetta
Malcolm & Marie
A l‚Äôabordage
Bergman Island
Sweet Thing
Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy
Spencer
Stillwater
The French Dispatch
The Card Counter
1/29/22, 9:45 am - +39 348 053 7444: From this list I've seen Wheel... and Benedetta. Both ok, nothing special, the second at least is very intriguing, but not at the level of the previous Verhoeven's film (Elle), excellent in my opinion.
1/29/22, 9:49 am - +39 348 053 7444: About 2021, telling before that I never distinguish between mainstream and not mainstream, my favorite movies among my still short list are: Nobody (Naishuller) and Petite Maman (Sciamma). Not masterpieces but in my opinion very good movies.
1/29/22, 9:51 am - +39 348 053 7444: I haven't seen Drive my car yet anyway. I have good expectations.
1/29/22, 4:30 pm - +30 694 955 1231: Benedetta
1/29/22, 4:33 pm - +48 733 499 999: One of the most Kitshy movie I have seen for long time. Lesbian nun and a lot of nudity is not enough for me. ;)
1/29/22, 4:33 pm - +48 733 499 999: Even amazing Charlotte Rampling doesnt save this film.
1/29/22, 4:34 pm - +48 515 536 338: It was so kitshy, I‚Äôd give it 2/10
1/29/22, 4:35 pm - +48 515 536 338: And it was so funny that the entire cinema laughed at it including me - one of the funniest movies I have seen
1/29/22, 4:36 pm - +48 733 499 999: I would give 4/10 only for Charlotte Rampling and Jesus like a Zorro cuting snakes with the sword scene. I‚Äôm not able to unwatch this scene.
1/29/22, 4:37 pm - +48 733 499 999: ;)
1/29/22, 4:38 pm - +48 733 499 999: Btw.: Gierek is also terrible. Beware! Even my mother didnt like it when Gierek decade was her most beutifull period in her life.

1/29/22, 6:01 pm - +39 328 955 6171: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubalda,_All_Naked_and_Warm

A really silly plot, but I would say it resembles an entire genre. But as far as I remember they are mostly about soldiers during the mandatory military service
1/29/22, 6:13 pm - +39 327 810 6575: That is called sexy comedy
1/29/22, 6:14 pm - +39 327 810 6575: What was more interesting is italian erotic of seventies
1/29/22, 6:17 pm - +39 348 053 7444: I would tell more Le monache di Sant'Arcangelo, Cristiana monaca indemoniata, La badessa di castro, Suor Emanuelle ecc ecc. I found a lot of them in Benedetta.
1/29/22, 6:18 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Nunsploitations
1/29/22, 6:21 pm - +48 570 415 962: I think Paul Verhoeven is coming back to his Dutch background, very clearmassage about different types of freedom. Despite lot of kitschy moments, the story of Benedetta is very interesting. This is real shameless pornography in a genre that has already managed to be forgotten. I remember some other similar movies,  "Mother Joanna from the Angels", "Devils", "Small Clocks".

1/29/22, 7:59 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Quel gran pezzo dell'Ubalda ecc was part of another kind of italian subgenre, called (trying to translate it in English) "decamerotic", than became popular after Pasolini's Decameron success. It lasted between 1972 and 1975.

2/2/22, 4:08 pm - +48 790 875 445: Monica Vitti leaves us and with her goes an actress of immense depth, great character and strong personality.  In an all or almost male cinema she and Anna Magnani represented female talent at the highest levels.  Perfect and credible in both drama and comedy, she leaves a hard legacy to fill.  All young actresses should study her performances.  They would draw a great, immense lesson from it.  In her long illness she had an admirable, exceptional man beside her: Roberto Russo.  To him my most sincere and strongest hug.

 Thanks Monica for everything you have given us.
 In laughter and reflection.‚ù§Ô∏è

2/10/22, 12:31 am - +39 348 053 7444: Very good movie! A curiosity: the Italian version released in December 1976 contained a spurious erotic insert shot by Italian distributors, who judged the movie too chaste compared with The Beast and Immoral Tales. It was quite well inserted, so much that it tricked the popular Italian writer Alberto Moravia, whom, rewiewing the movie for a newspaper, praised this fake as the apotheosis of Borowczyk's filmography.
2/10/22, 12:30 pm - +48 570 415 962: The book of Stefan Zeromski is also very good. I remember one teleplay of 1969 in Russia based on Story of Sin. It was also without erotic scenes. The film seems to be very interesting. Enjoy üòâ

2/24/22, 12:20 pm - +34 658 19 90 23: Of course, it has nothing to do. From my point of view, politics must be separated from the country itself, and also culture, films, language...has nothing to do with the actions of the actual government.

3/15/22, 4:00 pm - +48 570 415 962: Hello guys,

unfortunately this week our friend Bill can not present the movie and I would like to help and present film instead of him.

As a proposal, I have 3 movies for you and you can select the one of them for Thursday.

¬†

1. Nosferatu, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau, 1922

A masterwork of German Expressionism (and an unauthorised adaptation of Bram Stoker‚Äôs seminal novel Dracula),¬†

Nosferatu is the original vampire movie, and has lost none of its impact 100 years on. The ominous Count Orlok (immortally embodied with chilling physicality by Max Shreck) resides in a Transylvanian castle, until he decides he‚Äôs interested in a new residence ‚Äì and in the jugular of his real estate agent‚Äôs young wife.

3/15/22, 4:01 pm - +48 570 415 962: 2. The Great Dictator, Charlie Chaplin, 1940
I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt want to be an emperor. That‚Äôs not my business. I don‚Äôt want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. This movie has been done when Hitler ( and Mussolini who is as well in the movie) was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism. Charlie Chaplin demonstrates that his comedic voice is undiminished by dialogue in this rousing satire of tyranny.
Very famous and funney comedy with Charlie Chaplin who parodied the WWII dictators. Vary intresting to watch regardless of actual political context.

3/15/22, 4:02 pm - +48 570 415 962: 3. The Seventh Seal, Ingmar Bergman, 1957

The knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow) ¬†offers Death a game of chess for his life. Death agrees to the game, to which they will return several time during the moview, ut which Block cannot win. Classical drama of Swedesh Film Director Ingmar Bergman takes a form of medieval morality play, battle between black and white, darkness and light, death and life with a lot of bibliclal allegories.

1. Nobody is calling, 1960 
(Nikt nie wo≈Ça)
One of the most artistically beautiful Polish films. The stylized black and white photos reflect the state of the soul of a couple of young people completely lost in the new reality 
and the lunar landscape of a town populated by random inhabitants in postwar Poland.
3/17/22, 8:07 pm - +48 570 415 962: 2. Last day of summer, 
1958 (Ostatni dzie≈Ñ lata)
A poetic drama about the unfulfilled love of two weary and life-tired people, a study of the loneliness and helplessness of a woman and a man, unable to attempt a life 
together.The first author's film in Poland, the 
first serious attempt to find a new film language. Classic made by Tadeusz Konwicki, a writer responsible for most unique art house movies in Poland in that era
3/17/22, 8:07 pm - +48 570 415 962: 3. Farewells, 1958 
(Po≈ºegnania)
A film presenting a melancholy and 
grotesque settlement with the sphere of the pre-war intelligentsia, which impoverished spiritually and 
materially, and loses its social position and significance due to the 
war.

3/27/22, 9:20 pm - +48 570 415 962: I think this would be best possible choice, but film is not so good as it is described in different Reviews in US and movie critics. I would be more interested to select Drive my car. Definitely not Dune and Pizza which i did not like at all. Let's see tomorrow
3/27/22, 9:21 pm - +48 501 568 130: And Polish Sukienka can win

3/28/22, 4:46 pm - +351 961 435 562: It's just a bunch of clich√©s, the same formula seen in millions of other movies
3/28/22, 4:52 pm - +30 694 955 1231: This year was really mediocre as far as Oscars go
3/28/22, 4:52 pm - +48 501 568 130: Last year too
3/28/22, 4:54 pm - +48 503 769 590: Sounds like the Academy went fully woke this year (its not the first time) A film on themes like this usually wins , lame
3/28/22, 4:54 pm - +30 694 955 1231: I loved last year for me was the best of my life,ever.i loved all the films
3/28/22, 4:55 pm - +48 503 769 590: Compare that to 2020, with Joker, Parasite, JoJo Rabbit and Once upon a Time.. all classics
3/28/22, 4:56 pm - +30 694 955 1231: In total last year was better for me.the other years i had a lot of films i really hated along with the ones i loved
3/28/22, 4:57 pm - +30 694 955 1231: Last year none
3/28/22, 4:57 pm - +30 694 955 1231: I loved them all 100%

3/28/22, 5:28 pm - +48 694 783 781: Not. He stood up for his wife. What was awkward however was that Mr. Chris took that one straight without getting knocked down.
3/28/22, 5:29 pm - +48 501 568 130: It's not street. Did anyone punch Ricky Gervais for his jokes?
3/28/22, 5:34 pm - +48 694 783 781: I would. I dont know the other folks in other stand ups. If my partner would be visibly upset due to a joke I would take a stand.
3/28/22, 5:34 pm - +48 694 783 781: Do please share a clip where Ricky targeted a particular individual and cracked a joke at their disability.
3/28/22, 5:39 pm - +48 501 568 130: Joke was inappriopiate,of course
3/28/22, 5:39 pm - +48 501 568 130: Is punching someone for bad joke ok? In my opinion no
3/28/22, 5:40 pm - +48 782 980 271: You would think diffrently if it was about your Wifes desies which she is depressed about and went public not to long ago about.. You aren't a celebrity, most of us aren't. So we cant judge him. as we aren't anywhere close to his shoes.
3/28/22, 5:41 pm - +48 694 783 781: Its all right. For me, jokes or not, my lady's respect is important. And it is absolutely okay to agree to disagree.
3/28/22, 5:41 pm - +48 782 980 271: Ricky made fat jokes, while being fat himself. the two don't compare.
3/28/22, 5:42 pm - +48 782 980 271: Also it was a slap, in alot of cultures a slap like that is the exact punishment for public insults and such.
3/28/22, 5:42 pm - +48 501 568 130: Doesn't matter if he's famous or not. It's dark humour,bad joke of course but still,come on.
3/28/22, 5:42 pm - +48 790 875 445: The wife of will Smith is cheating on him since years, she thinks she is on an open relationship... Nevertheless will Smith defend her, but in a violent matter in front of all the world. Sorry but 1)she could defend herself 2) all jokes are OK as long as they don't touch will Smith? Wtf
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 790 875 445: Certainly Robert De Niro or Marlon brando with their brain and class
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 790 875 445: They would simply destroy Chris rock with words
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 790 875 445: No need to use the hands.
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 790 875 445: But that is just my humble opinion.
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 503 769 590: The joke was in poor taste but the slap was in poor taste x 10
3/28/22, 5:43 pm - +48 790 875 445: Agree with wojciech
3/28/22, 5:44 pm - +48 501 568 130: If we agree that we can punch people for bad jokes,well,it won't good world

https://twitter.com/JamesMelville/status/1508377605237616641?t=LqWU1GDw27CbWy_HCG1Dzg&s=08
3/28/22, 5:56 pm - +48 694 783 781: True that though.
3/28/22, 5:57 pm - +34 658 19 90 23: I agree with you, and this is very sad. There is no more freedom, they want us all under the "political correctness" and fake compassion
3/28/22, 6:07 pm - +48 570 415 962: I think it is for the time-being. I have read one article that Oscar has always reflected the ideals of leftist Hollywood, with its socio-utopian ideas about how the world works. The new rules are an attempt to give others a chance. For decades, Hollywood has been run by wealthy, white, middle-aged straight men. Now an attempt is being made to shake their monopoly - nothing more and nothing less. Whether it works or not, we'll see in a couple of years.
3/28/22, 7:38 pm - +48 663 117 652: It would seem like it belongs more to Sundance festival. But I guess Oscars have to do things differently once in a while.
3/28/22, 7:38 pm - +39 348 053 7444: All this things are very far from what I'm interested in about cinema, that for me is without limits and "not a slice of life but a piece of cake", quoting someone. Ethical stuff, gossip and good clothes for actors are not my field.
3/28/22, 7:40 pm - +39 348 053 7444: It doesn't mean that all the films passing from there are ugly (A promising young woman was a masterpiece in my opinion), but let's say the Academy is not my main source.
3/28/22, 7:44 pm - +48 570 415 962: You are right, it was like this in the past, no festival film at Oscar ceremony. Bit since last 2-3 years they are more bringing festival movies for Oscar awards, it seems lack of good screenplays or ideas or may be new stars. Anyway Oscar is really changing and we can forget thoese concept in Hollywood which was dominant for last 30 years
3/28/22, 10:52 pm - +380 66 353 4024: Checked the whole uncut moment of the smack. The joke was rude and awkward, I'd say even stupid. I know a woman with apolecia and it's not smth that you do to yourself for a change. It should be obvious for a smart comedian. It takes time to survive it and to accept it. It feels pain in Will Smith's voice. It's obviously a tender subject. He obviously lost his temper and it's not the best example for the audience, but I can't blame or judge him. He receives enough of that as a public person, so I can't play a hypocrite to look right. You are at risk to receive unpredictable reactions if you hurt someone's feelings in public.

3/28/22, 10:55 pm - +48 501 568 130: No,stand up comedy is about breaking boundaries.yes, joke was stupid and bad but it's still.a joke. You can't accept this kind of behaviour

3/28/22, 11:06 pm - +380 66 353 4024: Verbal violence often hurts much more than physical and it's more socially approved, so people use it a lot. It's not an excuse, but a nice example that it's important to think about other people's feelings, to be more sensitive and wise.
3/28/22, 11:07 pm - +380 66 353 4024: Of course they condemn, what else would they do
3/28/22, 11:08 pm - +48 501 568 130: Well,if you read comments on Polish internet many people say that what Smith done was justified. If USA they look completely different on violence and stand up comedy

3/28/22, 11:12 pm - +380 66 353 4024: It's sad situation actually
3/28/22, 11:13 pm - +48 501 568 130: And? Is it forbidden to bring humour to sad situation?
3/28/22, 11:18 pm - +380 66 353 4024: The whole situation with the verbal rudeness and physical violence is sad (the slap is a classic answer to the offensive language, but I agree that it shouldn't be normalised)

3/29/22, 8:48 am - +380 66 353 4024: Yes, he also apologized at the ceremony and it's absolutely normal to condemn such behaviour by the Academy. I would be shocked and surprised if they wouldn't have done that. I agree that he was in a horrible emotional state. I also spot a suggestion that it a was a total act from Will's side to impress his wife or smth. At the same time there's an impression that hurting woman's feelings is socially acceptable while hurting male comedian's is publicly crucified. I obviously judge from a female's perspective.
3/29/22, 10:53 am - +48 782 980 271: exacly, ppl forget that words hurt alot more, and she didn't go there to get roasted, it wasn't a standup night.
3/29/22, 1:09 pm - +48 663 117 652: My admiration goes to Chris Rock for just going ahead with the show and being unfazed by the slap.'
3/29/22, 1:09 pm - +48 501 568 130: Agree
3/29/22, 1:23 pm - +48 733 499 999: It is so lovelly to see this group active at least once a year. Have you heard this conspiracy theory, that  Will Smith slap the guy because he wants to make our movie group active? :)

5/26/22, 10:25 am - +48 733 499 999: A few quotes from review of today film:
5/26/22, 10:25 am - +48 733 499 999: Like many great films, ‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù takes its nominal subjects as occasions for much larger statements about human nature.
5/26/22, 10:26 am - +48 733 499 999: <Media omitted>
5/26/22, 10:27 am - +48 733 499 999: ‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù creates deep feelings among many members of its audiences, and it does that not so much with its story or even its characters as with particular moments that are very sharply seen and heard.
5/26/22, 10:29 am - +48 733 499 999: Seen, in photography that pays grave attention to the precise look of a human face during stress, pain, defeat, victory, and joy. Heard, in one of the most remarkable sound tracks of any film in a long time, with music by the Greek composer Vangelis Papathanassiou. His compositions for ‚ÄúChariots of Fire‚Äù are as evocative, and as suited to the material, as the different but also perfectly matched scores of such films as "The Third Man" and "Zorba the Greek."
5/26/22, 10:31 am - +48 733 499 999: The soundtrack is trully so famous, and listen to it so often on my favorite RMF classic radio, that I‚Äôm shocked that I have never seen this film. ;)
5/26/22, 10:32 am - +48 733 499 999: Simply I was probably affraid of the title that sounds as another Marvel style superhero production. ;)
5/26/22, 10:33 am - +48 733 499 999: Here it is and we will listen to it before the movie as well. :) https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CSav51fVlKU
5/26/22, 10:34 am - +48 733 499 999: Movie takes more than 2 hours, so please come earlier than usual as we would like to start arround 7:15 pm.

5/29/22, 11:49 am - +48 570 415 962: It is not only funny but very intelligent and  great actor and director. If you watched Avengers with Scarlett Johansson, Jerzy played there as well. He told at festival he signed 200 page contract for Avengers where 50% was about Scarlett. He was not allowed to do any harassment during making of film and other things

6/2/22, 8:27 am - +48 733 499 999: NYT review of our today movie But ‚ÄúDeep End,‚Äù which opened yesterday at the Paris 7 heater, is a somewhat different and an altogether happier matter. At once, fun nier and more tragic, more serious and more relaxed, it is recognizably the work of its director in every frame‚Äî and at the same time the work of a director who has come to feel at ease with his insights and his own ways of developing them.

I'm not sure that I know why. Perhaps it is the calm of old age (Skolimowski is now pushing 33); perhaps it is color (all the previous Skolimowski films to have played here were in moody black and white); perhaps it is London, where the film takes place; certainly it is at least in part the wonderful presence of John Moulder Brown and Jane Asher as his hero and heroine.
6/2/22, 8:35 am - +48 733 499 999: And here some posters from the film:

Because one dog is fine but Two stranger dogs my bark to each other. Also if you come with this one dog please sit as far from entrance as possible therefore people entering the room will not step on her / him.

7/30/22, 9:42 am - +48 733 499 999: Dear movie lovers!

There was some presure to play comedy movies. Well I don't mind good and clever comedies at all, but simply don't want to make this genre as a main interest of us. At the end of a day this is a good movies with Pawel project, not a comedies with Pawel... üòâ
.
But then on the greatest radio station of all rmf classic, (where they play film music and talk a lot about cinema) I listen to the programme where they did talk about Polish classic comedy, that we have never screened for 7 years of our movie club existance! Coincidence? üòâ
.
So the God of the cinema made very clear suggestion which Polish film we should play! üôÇ
.
It will be also the only one or one of 2 only screening of Polish movies in August, as I'm guiding in different cities in Poland this summer so I'm often not in town on Thu. (The other will be foreign movies handle by Andrey, Bill and Paolo) But this one for sure I will have pleasure to present by myself.
.
We expext quite a number of ppl. So please write in the comments here, if you are planing to join us.
.
May great cinema be with You! üôÇ

According to result in our voting poll, I decided to screen classic of classic. So we will screen the movie which made Polish cinema famous, posh and artsy world wide for the first, but not the last time. Ashes and diamonds, the most famous piece of Polish movie school period! :)

8/11/22, 8:26 am - +48 733 499 999: ‚ÄûAndrzej Wajda‚Äôs Ashes and Diamonds (1958) has rightly been lauded as one of the finest of postwar East-Central European films, and the most vital work of the Polish School, the group of filmmakers who, starting in the midfifties, cast startlingly truthful images of the recent war and its aftermath, putting Polish cinema on the world map.‚Äù

8/30/22, 11:41 pm - +48 570 415 962: An excellent film about the confrontation between two illusionists. Lot of good actors
8/30/22, 11:45 pm - +39 348 053 7444: I was actually talking about City of God. The Prestige didn"t impress me too much, emotionally it left me cold.
8/30/22, 11:47 pm - +48 570 415 962: OK, I see. But fo you like any other film of Christopher Jonathan Nolan besides Batman?
8/30/22, 11:52 pm - +39 348 053 7444: I'm still missing Following, Tenet and the first ans third Batman. My favorite are Memento and The Dark Knight, very good movies. Then Insomnia and Insterstellar, good movies, both a little weak in the end. Then all the rest, with The Prestige at the top of this "rest".

9/16/22, 10:04 am - +48 797 233 009: Thank you for screening this incredible Jean-Luc Godard film last night, "Vivre sa vie"! I'd never seen it before. It was mind-blowing.
9/16/22, 10:29 am - +48 733 952 999: Hi Scotia, so glad that you enjoyed the film, hope to see you at future filmsüòä
9/16/22, 12:25 pm - +48 503 769 590: Perhaps one day we can screen Alain Resnais' '59 Hiroshima Non Amour... Its mind-blowing as well :) and ahead of its time
9/16/22, 12:43 pm - +48 570 415 962: I so glad that you guys started screening New wave movies, it is really great experience and make, sense to watch. Resnais, Godard, Truffaut, Chabrol and others.   I watched some  of films of these directors and enjoyed. Good alternative to House of Dragon and The Rings of Powerü§Æ
9/16/22, 12:49 pm - +48 503 769 590: They say the French are credited for the 'cool' New Wave films, but what about the Polish new wave films like Pozegnania (1958) which Pawel screened a couple of months ago (amazingly great film) and released in 1958 !! 4 years before Vivre by Lic Goddard !!  (Must make a special mention of Innocent Sorcerers (1960 by Wajda also)..
9/16/22, 2:03 pm - +48 570 415 962: It is good question. In my opinion Polish New wave is more Jerzy Skolimowski and Roman Pilanski before they migrated from Poland. I presented film Departure by Skolimowski and Godard highly recognized it. Pozegnania is amazing film but not so many experiments there with editing and script. It is based on lyrical novel. Anyway there are all good movies
9/16/22, 2:20 pm - +48 515 536 338: What do you mean by ‚Äú new wave‚Äù?
9/16/22, 2:26 pm - +48 570 415 962: New wave is like new way of cinema very opposite to French cinema of 1940s-middle of 1950s. Big article in Wikipedia about it.
9/16/22, 2:41 pm - +48 503 769 590: Hmm i think Po≈ºegnanie has many elements of new wave in it, for example in the nightclub scene with the long takes and the witty script, but i know what you mean
9/16/22, 7:16 pm - +48 784 999 676: @48733952999 I had to go. How was the discussion?
9/18/22, 7:35 pm - +48 570 415 962: Hi there.

9/26/22, 3:26 pm - +48 733 499 999: When it comes to significant authors who have made the world of film indebted, there are üëâimportant directors. There are üëâ very important directors. And there is also üëâKrzysztof Kie≈õlowski.

The man who gave us üëè"The Decalogue", üëè"A Short Film About Killing,üëè"The Double Life of Veronica and the üëè"Three Colors" Trilogy, is widely regarded as one of the key figures of European cinema. Many years ago, Kie≈õlowski changed our stupid life.

By opening our minds and hearts to him, we experienced a change in the way we watched - and felt! - movies. For this we are forever grateful. Kie≈õlowski üî• is the magic of the film. Kie≈õlowski üî• is the love of cinema. Kie≈õlowski üî• is a cinema.

If you find it hard to believe he came from us, listen to a voice with much greater authority: the great üëÄStanley Kubrick once said that the Decalogue was the best thing he had seen in years, even wishing he had done it himself! üèÜüì∫

This Thursday at good movies with Pawel we will watch Kie≈õlowski's feature debut,  "The Scar", the main role was played by the recently died legendary Polish actor Franciszek Pieczka. Therefore the meeting will be an opportunity to remind a person who did so much to the cinema.

10/21/22, 12:40 am - +48 733 499 999: Nevertheless Judy life was difficult, her selfesteem was constantly questioned by producents. She had 5 housbands, Bill event said than one of them was a gangster in which death young Lisa was involved...
10/21/22, 12:41 am - +48 733 499 999: Judy died overdosing medicine a few years in the 60ties.
10/21/22, 12:42 am - +48 733 499 999: In the 70ties Lisa Minelli played main role in the cabaret. Which on one hand isa kind of a  story of her mother. On the other hand it was begining of her huge career.
10/21/22, 12:45 am - +48 733 499 999: She used her complicated background, difficult family situation as her advantages. Not to mention that thanks to this movie a dark short hair, not necesarly tall, women was presented as the most shining example of sexapeal.
10/21/22, 12:47 am - +48 733 499 999: So this movie is also a very inspiring example of struggle for body positivism. I‚Äôm really gratefull and proud that we screened it today!

10/21/22, 9:24 pm - +48 733 499 999: For her performance as Sally in the film, Minnelli reinterpreted the character and‚Äîat the explicit suggestion of her father, film and stage director Vincente Minnelli‚Äîshe deliberately imitated film actress Louise Brooks, a flapper icon and sex symbol of the Jazz Age Brooks, much like the character of Sally Bowles in the film, was an aspiring actress and American expat who temporarily moved to Weimar Berlin in search of international stardom. Minnelli later recalled:

"I went to my father and asked him, 'What can you tell me about 1930s glamour? Should I be emulating Marlene Dietrich or something?' And he said 'No, study everything you can about Louise Brooks.'"

10/21/22, 9:55 pm - +48 733 499 999: Guys there are so many classical movies about the period, that we really don‚Äôt have to play recent mainstream Hollywood movies, because it is about the same period.
10/21/22, 10:07 pm - +48 784 999 676: I am very interested in the recent suggestions!
10/21/22, 10:12 pm - +48 570 415 962: Pawe≈Ç it is co-production, England, France and Czech Republic, but I see your point
10/21/22, 10:38 pm - +48 503 769 590: Yup, a film like Cabaret, is the kind you never forget. Its period setting is what makes it all the more interesting.. an era with sex, drugs and instead of rockNroll... cabaret . Another film connected to this era, at the time the Nazis came to power is Mephisto, its a good one.. Not about burlesque exactly, but about a stage actor. It won best foreign film in 1981.
10/21/22, 10:40 pm - +48 784 999 676: @48503769590 Interesting. I haven't heard of it. Thanks.
10/22/22, 11:56 am - +48 570 415 962: Very good movie  I have seen it. Hungarian film director Istv√°n Szab√≥, about great actor who start cooperating with Nazists for his career ambitious. Connected with story of Faust. I have seen it once and very recommend to everybody

10/28/22, 4:36 pm - +48 733 499 999: Guys here a little more info about Rosemary baby:
10/28/22, 4:36 pm - +48 733 499 999: The scene in which Rosemary is raped by Satan was ranked No. 23 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

In 2010, The Guardian ranked the film the second-greatest horror film of all time.

In 2014, it was deemed "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
10/28/22, 4:37 pm - +48 733 499 999: I understand your claims that it is not as scary as recent movies, but I would like to also pay attention that 3 ppl who said that all were man...
10/28/22, 4:39 pm - +48 733 499 999: Rosemary babe is not only horror about fear and paranoia it is also about matherhood and parrenting. Well I guess most of guys didn‚Äôt really feel seriously scared about option of having child from rape, not to mention rape by satan.
10/28/22, 4:40 pm - +48 733 499 999: Also in contradiction to many contemporary movies Rosemary babe doesnt used any phisical violence, bloody Images of body parts ets... it is only purely psychological, neverheless still keep us in tention. A masterpiece!

10/28/22, 4:42 pm - +48 515 536 338: But its a fair point, most if not all old time horror movies are not really scary at all. Or please challenge me with a scary one ‚ò∫Ô∏è
10/28/22, 4:43 pm - +48 515 536 338: I think we are now oversaturated with the recent techniques to take the old horror movies seriously
10/28/22, 4:45 pm - +48 515 536 338: To me the movie was more uncomfortable then scary, but its a good one nevertheless
10/28/22, 5:00 pm - +39 348 053 7444: The fear is something subjective, and a masterpiece like Rosemary's Baby is, in my opinion, beyond this concept of scary/not scary.
10/28/22, 5:06 pm - +39 348 053 7444: I also add the for me is more difficult to find a horror movie with a real tension (the fear is not a feeling I associate to movies) among the contemporary ones, than the older ones. Jump scares, splatter scenes and even worse digital effects are the opposite of my concept of tension, but of course it's my point of view.
10/28/22, 6:11 pm - +48 570 415 962: I think it is dependent hoe horror is done, if you are worrying about heros in the film, waiting that good guy will win the monster or girl defend herself from maniacs.  I was really worring about the girl in film Carrie, 1976 or another girl in Dracula movie 1992. Lot of old films are made without special effects but sensitive. Today we are overboarded by computers effects and films with simple story for teneeger level, and we are not afraid at all.
Aldo I think watching horror require atmosphere at home without speaking people at home, chatting or when we are cooking
10/28/22, 6:16 pm - +48 515 536 338: Fear is subjective, but modern movied like Paranormal Activity, The ring or The Exprcists dont compare in my opinion to any of the old time horror classics. I find the modern ones more psychologically complex.

Even comparing the sequells to the old versions - the old one is always milder in my opinion
10/28/22, 6:19 pm - +48 515 536 338: Lets comare them to Hitchhock classics like Birds or Psycho, I think they cannot scare the modern movie goers
10/28/22, 6:33 pm - +48 570 415 962: I think you are right, however I can tell now people are not taking many horror films seriously as before. We are more adopted to special effects which catch some key elements of horror, present in quick and simple way with brutality,  show more blood and actions. It is commercial trend in industry adopted for average rate people who want more entertainment in short term.
I.like that Pawe≈Ç show different films in movie club, so we can watch different films
10/28/22, 6:36 pm - +48 515 536 338: I once heard and  opinion that asian horror movies are the best ( in therms of the ability to scare the viewer), I watched a few and have to agree - never watched a horror movie again üòÜ
10/28/22, 6:41 pm - +48 515 536 338: For the Halloween weekend, maybe someone can recommend some good horror movies (not mainstream)?
10/28/22, 6:52 pm - +48 570 415 962: Hellraiser (Clive Barker, 1987, ) or Tetsuo: The Iron Man (Director:¬†Shinya Tsukamoto, 1989, Japan). I really liked both of them. First is famous and created lot of sequels. Japanese horror is not so famous, it is cult classic body horror about metal fetishist who become Iron man in the end, about metamorphosis of his body.
10/28/22, 6:53 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Personally I disagree about everything, except the quality of the movies you mentioned, except Paranormal Activity, that it's in my opinion cute anyway. My idea is that movies with a great tension, great psychological potraits ecc can be found in all the countries and, at least from the 60s, ages. Even if, personally, I never understood the status of cult movie of The Birds. For me one of the worst Hitchcock of his American period.
10/28/22, 6:53 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Very brave advise Tetsuo!
10/28/22, 6:56 pm - +48 570 415 962: Yes, I was shared a lot by this film. The film Titane, 2021 it is just comedy in comparison to Tetsuo
10/28/22, 6:57 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Titane without Tetsuo wouldn"t exist (and it would me better, for course in my opinion)
10/28/22, 6:57 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Of course*
10/28/22, 7:00 pm - +39 348 053 7444: I recently enjoyed a little low budget australian horror titled Lake Mungo. Otherwise, something less not-mainstream, In the Mouth of Madness, The Wailing, Phenomena, The Innocents....

Next week we will continue Halloween theme by screening the movie of Francis Ford Coppola - Dracula, 1992 with Gary Oldman, Keanu Reaves, and my favorite Winona Ryder. This film is one of my favorite about vampires, glorious and groundbreaking fantasy cinema, a film that retells the Dracula legend with buckets of visual style, and one that inaugurated a new way of conceptualising the vampire myth: loyal, loving, swaggering, soulful, sexy and hip.
Looking forward to you in Literacka next Thursday

11/2/22, 1:16 pm - +48 515 536 338: Guys, would anyone be able to tell me if there is any difference between neo - noir film and a thriller? Or thriller is a moder film noir therefore neo noir?
11/2/22, 1:16 pm - +48 515 536 338: <Media omitted>
11/2/22, 1:27 pm - +48 790 875 445: Good question, in my understanding a noir is more relatable to older 50-60 movies... And thriller came later... So defining a thriller a neo noir maybe is correct... But I'll leave a more correct explanation to someone else as I am no expert in this subject.
11/2/22, 1:32 pm - +48 515 536 338: No, but movies like Blue Velvet, basically all of David Lynch are called specifically neo noir, so the later version of the 40-50s noir. So I was wondering
11/2/22, 1:36 pm - +48 515 536 338: The noir genere has its specific points that make the movie a film noir. So I guess, not all thrillers are film noir but some, that can prove those noir points can be called neo noir.

So maybe neo noir is a specific style in thriller genre.

But then, can we call 40s noir a thriller??
11/2/22, 1:37 pm - +48 515 536 338: And can we then call Blue velvet a neo noir and a thriller?
11/2/22, 1:37 pm - +48 570 415 962: If I remember correctly, neo noir is word from 1970s, the same as noir but more tough topics like corruption,  violence in family, detective without good guys etc. Noir is genre mainly American, criminal stories based on American literature, beautiful women, plays with lighting. Thriller is multi genre, big tension during film and expecation for outcome.
Alfred Hickock is master of thriller. Just forgotten that Noir was always done according to rules of Hays code with very puritanical rules, lack of sex, violence, clear gender rols
11/2/22, 1:39 pm - +48 730 767 458: In my opinion Thriller is wider than noir. Thriller can be actually with many topic, even sci-fi. Neo-noir is usually related to crimes and usually is about real situation
11/2/22, 1:39 pm - +48 515 536 338: Interesting thank you, so all noir or neo noir movies are thrillers but not all thrillers are noir genre?
11/2/22, 1:40 pm - +48 515 536 338: Yes, so in this case someobe would need to have a deeper knowledge in movies to be able to derive the sub types
11/2/22, 1:40 pm - +48 730 767 458: I would say so:)
11/2/22, 1:42 pm - +48 730 767 458: Art is hard to strictly categorize but I would say in this case noir/neo-noir are included in the thriller big family:)
11/2/22, 1:42 pm - +48 515 536 338: In this case, I wonder if there are any other sub genres. It seems it would be the only one that is such a big fillar in a movie history

11/2/22, 1:46 pm - +48 731 663 987: Far as I know a "noir" is the french name for a classic crime story , thriller is not necessary a crime story but broader, you have "psychological thrillers", "horror thriler", "scifi thriller"
11/2/22, 1:46 pm - +48 731 663 987: noir is also more an European thing and thriller more and American one

11/26/22, 1:46 pm - +48 570 415 962: Hi guys. One interesting fact about Martin Scorsese. 
Martin Scorsese has collected more  Oscar nominations tha another living directors. One of those eight nominations earned him the best director award for the crime drama "The Departed".

The cult picture of Scorsese "Taxi Driver" was the reason for a high-profile political scandal. Young John Hinckley fell involved love  so deeply in Jodie Foster, who played a prostitute girl in the film, that he began to go after the actress, create poems and notes under her door, and then decided to make a strong impression on the sweetheart - to kill the president. Ronald Reagan was dangerously wounded by six shots from Hinckley, but survived, as did the others. The shooter was declared insane and was released from St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 2016.

11/26/22, 1:53 pm - +48 784 999 676: I highly recommend 'Taxi Driver.' While I have yet to see it, the movie is considered an American classic, and it launched the career of Jodie Foster.
11/26/22, 2:12 pm - +39 348 053 7444: Taxi Driver is one of my favorite movies ever, but I strongly recommend After Hours, in my opinion a great movie rarely mentioned among Scorsese's masterpieces
11/26/22, 2:31 pm - +48 570 415 962: Great film with dark humor. When I saw this movie first time, I told myself: thanks that my Friday party was not the same as IT guy had in this film

11/27/22, 1:57 pm - +48 797 233 009: I would love to see all of these Scorsese films. I won't be able to come, though, because it's the "Masters of Spanish Cinema" festival this week at Pod Baranami!
